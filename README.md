### About Me :man_technologist: :

Frontend Developer from Turkey combining skills with hard work...

I have started my development journey in early 2022 and progressing fast ever since.
I am currently on a bootcamp and doing some voluntary work for friends and family who need quality web sites.
I am open to full-time positions and freelance projects as well as voluntary work so I can contribute and develop further.
